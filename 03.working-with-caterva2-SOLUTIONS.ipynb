    "In this tutorial we will see how to work with remote datasets using Blosc2 and Caterva2, a library that allows you to manage large remote datasets, providing a client-server architecture. Caterva2 is built on top of Blosc2, so it can handle large datasets efficiently using all the tools and tricks you've learned in the previous tutorials."

    "\n",
    "Computational paradigms for remote data often require downloading data to the local machine to compute with it, which can be excessively computationally demanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is solved by Caterva2, which allows us to work with remote datasets in a more flexible way, doing as much as possible on the server side, and only downloading the data we really want to consult. You can also perform all sorts of file management operations (move, delete, copy datasets, etc.) on the server side - see the [Caterva2 documentation](https://ironarray.io/caterva2-doc/tutorials/API.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "First we set up a connection from the client (our local machine) to the server, and define a pointer to the root where our desired dataset is stored. The root is a special directory that contains all the datasets we want to work with, and it is defined by the `@` symbol followed by the name of the root (in this case, `@public`). We'll then time the process of opening the remote dataset, and check the memory usage before and after opening it."
