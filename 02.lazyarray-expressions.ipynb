    "# Tutorial 2: Expressions containing NDArray objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Python-Blosc2 implements a powerful way to operate with NDArray arrays and other objects, called \"lazy expressions\".  A lazy expression is a lightweight object which stores a desired computation symbolically, with references to its operands (stored on disk or in memory), but does not execute until data is explicitly requested, e.g. if a slice of the computation result is requested. The lazy expression will then execute, but only on the necessary portion of the data, making it especially efficient, and avoiding large in-memory computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will see how to do such lazy computations, which are especially useful when working with large arrays, owing to this avoidance of costly in-memory temporaries.\n"
